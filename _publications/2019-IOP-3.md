title: "Preferential attachment graphs as agent interaction structure"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2019-IOP-3
excerpt: 'The preferential attachment graphs are considered as the basis for constructing agent interaction structures. The choice of such a structure has a great influence on the results of network processes simulation. Calibration (adjusting generation parameters) of the preferential attachment graphs improves the accuracy of the simulated processes results. An increase in the quality of calibration leads to the construction of adequate graph models. It can be used in processes simulation of telecommunication networks, social networks, cell molecular networks and other large networks of the modern networked world.'
